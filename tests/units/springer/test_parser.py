        "It was known that quantum curves and super Chern-Simons matrix models correspond to each other. "
        "From the viewpoint of symmetry, the algebraic curve of genus one, called the del Pezzo curve, enjoys "
        "symmetry of the exceptional algebra, while the super Chern-Simons matrix model is described by the free "
        "energy of topological strings on the del Pezzo background with the symmetry broken. We study the symmetry "
        "breaking of the quantum cousin of the algebraic curve and reproduce the results in the super Chern-Simons matrix model.",
        "We discuss in detail the distributions of energy, radial pressure and tangential pressure inside the nucleon. "
        "In particular, this discussion is carried on in both the instant form and the front form of dynamics. Moreover "
        "we show for the first time how these mechanical concepts can be defined when the average nucleon momentum does "
        "not vanish. We express the conditions of hydrostatic equilibrium and stability in terms of these two and "
        "three-dimensional energy and pressure distributions. We briefly discuss the phenomenological relevance of our "
        "findings with a simple yet realistic model. In the light of this exhaustive mechanical description of the "
        "nucleon, we also present several possible connections between hadronic physics and compact stars, like e.g. "
        "the study of the equation of state for matter under extreme conditions and stability constraints.",
        "This paper describes a strategy for a general search used by the ATLAS Collaboration to find potential indications "
        "of new physics. Events are classified according to their final state into many event classes. For each event class "
        "an automated search algorithm tests whether the data are compatible with the Monte Carlo simulated expectation in s"
        "everal distributions sensitive to the effects of new physics. The significance of a deviation is quantified using "
        "pseudo-experiments. A data selection with a significant deviation defines a signal region for a dedicated follow-up "
        "analysis with an improved background expectation. The analysis of the data-derived signal regions on a new dataset "
        "allows a statistical interpretation without the large look-elsewhere effect. The sensitivity of the approach is "
        "discussed using Standard Model processes and benchmark signals of new physics. As an example, results are shown "
        "for 3.2 fb $$^{-1}$$ of proton–proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 $$\\text {TeV}$$ collected with the ATLAS detector "
        "at the LHC in 2015, in which more than 700 event classes and more than $$10^5$$ regions have been analysed. No significant "
        "deviations are found and consequently no data-derived signal regions for a follow-up analysis have been defined.",
        "The detection of gravitational waves with ground-based laser interferometers has opened a new window to test and constrain"
        " General Relativity (GR) in the strong, dynamical, and non-linear regime. In this paper, we follow an agnostic approach and"
        " we study the quasi-normal modes of gravitational perturbations of Johannsen black holes under the assumptions of the validity"
        " of the Einstein Equations and of low values of the black hole spin parameter and deformation parameters. We find that the"
        " deformation parameter $$\\alpha _{13}$$ has a stronger impact on the quasi-normal modes than the other leading order deformation"
        " parameters ( $$\\alpha _{22}$$ , $$\\alpha _{52}$$ , and $$\\epsilon _{3}$$ ). We derive a fitting formula for the fundamental"
        " modes with $$l=2$$ and $$l=3$$ for the deformation parameter $$\\alpha _{13}$$ valid in the slow rotation approximation"
        " ( $$a_* < 0.4$$ ). Finally, we constrain $$\\alpha _{13}$$ from the event GW170104; within our analysis, we find that"
        " the data of GW170104 are consistent with the predictions of GR.",
        "It is shown how spin one vector matter fields can be coupled to a Yang–Mills theory. Such matter fields are defined as "
        "belonging to a representation $\\textit{R}$ of this Yang–Mills gauge algebra $$\\mathfrak {g}$$ . It is also required that"
        " these fields together with the original gauge fields be the gauge fields of an embedding total gauge algebra"
        " $$\\mathfrak {g}_{\\textrm{tot}}$$ . The existence of a physically consistent Yang–Mills action for the total algebra"
        " is finally required. These conditions are rather restrictive, as shown in some examples: non-trivial solutions may"
        " or may not exist depending on the choice of the original algebra $$\\mathfrak {g}$$ and of the representation $\\textit{R}$."
        " Some examples are shown, the case of the initial algebra $$\\mathfrak {g}$$ = $$\\mathfrak {u}(1)\\oplus \\mathfrak {su}(2)$$ "
        "being treated in more detail.",
        "We report measurements of the absolute branching fractions $$\\mathcal{B}\\left({B}_{s}^{0}\\to {D}_{s}^{\\pm }X\\right)$$ , "
